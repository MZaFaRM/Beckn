# Assignment 1: Beckn-UKI Soil Testing Integration

This repository contains the solution for **Assignment 1**, which focuses on integrating the **Beckn Protocol** with the **Unified Krishi Interface (UKI)** for soil testing services.

## File Structure

-   **[`beckn-uki-soil.md`](./beckn-uki-soil.md)**: A comprehensive guide explaining the application of the Beckn Protocol to soil testing services in the UKI context.
-   **[`api-reference.md`](./api-reference.md)**: Detailed API reference for the Beckn-compliant endpoints used in the UKI for Soil Testing.

## Objective

This assignment demonstrates the integration of Beckn Protocol to enable interoperability between farmer-facing (BAP) and provider-facing (BPP) platforms, specifically for soil testing services. The solution includes an open, farmer-centric network where farmers can access services like soil testing, input delivery, and crop advisory using interoperable digital interfaces.

## Usage

### 1. **Beckn-UKI Soil Testing Integration**

The **[`beckn-uki-soil.md`](./beckn-uki-soil.md)** file outlines how the Beckn Protocol is applied specifically for **soil testing** services. It covers:

-   The key phases in the service flow.
-   Role-wise API endpoints for BAP, BG, and BPP.
-   How soil testing services are delivered using the UKI network.

### 2. **API Reference**

The [`api-reference.md`](./api-reference.md) file contains all the necessary details about the Beckn Protocolâ€™s API endpoints used for soil testing services. It includes the endpoints, methods, request/response schemas, and the respective platform roles (BAP, BG, BPP).
